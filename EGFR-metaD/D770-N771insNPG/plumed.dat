# Distances describing the two saltbridges K745(NZ):E762(CD) and K745(ΝΖ):D855(CG)

# Distance between the two distance
# When both saltbridges are formed, the distance between the two distances (CV)
# is close to 0. This CV is able to characterise the displacement of the fuctionally important
# E762 located in the aC helix of the N-lobe in its transition from the so-called "aC-in" to "aC-out" conformation
